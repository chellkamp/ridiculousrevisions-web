# ridiculousrevisions-web

Ridiculous Revisions is an amateur podcast launched back in March 2021.  This project houses the code for the podcast's website.

## Site Architecture
This is a NodeJS website implemented under the Next.js and React frameworks.  It scrapes the podcast's official feed (hosted elsewhere) and ties it together with show notes that are stored in a MongoDB or DocumentDB instance.  Authentication for maintenance users is handled by AWS Cognito.

This project may be run locally or it may be packaged for deployment on an AWS Elastic Beanstalk server.
